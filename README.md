# multi-label-hierarchical-classification
In multi-label hierarchical classification problems, each example can be associated with one or more classes simultaneously belonging to a hierarchical level of subclass or superclass. This classification is performed through learning techniques, which, from a trained database, define the set of classes that an instance will be associated with. However, there is a problem in the multi-label classification that is associated with the classifiers of the techniques, which do not predict the number of classes that will be defined for new instances presented to the classification model. In the current Literature of Machine Learning and Data Mining, these classifiers only define in the test phase the set of classes of an example of input with a pre-defined quantity in the training phase. classes that will be associated with a new instance, such that it is contained in a set of hierarchical and multi-label entry.
